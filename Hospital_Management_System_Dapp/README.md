## The problem DECENTRALIZED PERSONAL HEALTH RECORD APPLICATION solves

&nbsp;


-Currently, the hospitals use traditional methods to store critical medical data of the patients and that data is indirectly subject to various attacks and thefts.

-In digital health records in centralized system, data sharing and privacy preservation are big challenges since medical data is sensitive.

-To design a decentralized application that is secure , private and where doctors are given a dependable way to maintain patient privacy while storing information about medical history.

-To design a system which is more patient centric so, if patient wishes only then their health records will be shared with the doctors.

-To develop a system that stores and displays the patients medical data to save time during emergency situations.

-Provide secure storage for patient information: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology would ensure that patient data is stored in a secure and tamper-proof manner, protecting it from unauthorized access or breaches.

-Facilitate data sharing: The system would allow authorized healthcare providers and researchers to access and share patient data in accordance with patient consent and data privacy regulations.

-Improve data interoperability: The system would enable the sharing of patient data between different healthcare organizations and systems, which would improve the continuity of care and medical research.

-Automate healthcare-related processes: Smart contracts on the blockchain platform could automate various processes such as claims processing, medical research and medical billing.

-Enable patient control over their data: Patients would have the ability to control and manage access to their personal health information (PHI) through the use of digital identity and consent management tools.

-So in order to enhance the hospital's digital health system, we propose a "Decentralized Medical data sharing & storage application based on blockchain."
